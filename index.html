        <h2>iPhone 15</h2>
<p>Apple's iPhone 15 Pro models represent a new milestone in the iPhone lineup. For the first time, the Pro version truly joins the ranks of the iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Mac Pro — devices built for professionals who demand more. The iPhone 15 Pro is designed as a tool and an instrument, offering just a little extra in the right places, but in ways that matter a lot to power users. It is the best of what Apple has to offer in a smartphone.</p>


<p align="center"><img src="images/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-1.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="iPhone 15"/></p>

<h3>The best smartphone screen currently available</h3>
<p>According to the analysis of <a href="http://www.displaymate.com/" title="DisplayMate" target="_blank">DisplayMate</a> experts, the Super <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Display_XDR" title="Pro Display XDR" target="_blank">Retina XDR display</a> of the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max is among the best smartphone screens ever made. As expected, <em><strong>Apple's displays</strong></em> continue to set industry standards year after year.</p>

<p>The Super Retina XDR screen has achieved the highest DisplayMate A+ rating. It reaches a peak brightness of 1,000 nits for typical use, 1,600 nits for HDR content, and up to an incredible 2,000 nits outdoors in direct sunlight. This makes the iPhone 15’s display one of the brightest and most visible in real-world conditions. In addition, the OLED panel offers an impressive contrast ratio of 2,000,000:1, perfect color accuracy, and support for HDR10 and Dolby Vision formats.</p>

<p>The iPhone 15 Pro lineup also introduces <strong>ProMotion</strong> with adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz, making scrolling, animations, and gaming feel smoother and more responsive than ever before. The Taptic Engine powers <em>Haptic Touch</em>, which provides precise feedback across the interface.</p>

<p>Screen sizes and resolutions vary by model. The iPhone 15 has a 6.1-inch OLED display with a resolution of 2556 × 1179 pixels at 460 ppi, while the iPhone 15 Plus features a 6.7-inch OLED display with a resolution of 2796 × 1290 pixels at 460 ppi. The iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max share the same sizes but with slimmer bezels and support for Always-On display technology. Each device also includes <em>True Tone</em>, which automatically adjusts the white balance and colors to match ambient light for a more natural viewing experience.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-2.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="iPhone 15" align="middle"/></p>

<h3>With iOS 17 on board</h3>
<p>Apple's official document with all the new features of iOS 17 is extensive, but we will overview only the most important features.</p>
<p>iOS 17 introduces several new capabilities, including interactive widgets, enhanced AirDrop with NameDrop, and major improvements to Messages and FaceTime. The system also expands customization options, allowing users to personalize their lock screen, widgets, and notifications more than ever before.</p>
<p>The Camera and Photos apps in iOS 17 take advantage of the iPhone 15’s powerful hardware, offering improved photo editing, new photographic styles, and better low-light performance. The Photos app also introduces more advanced organization features with AI-powered recognition.</p>
<p>Privacy remains a central focus. With features like Mail Privacy Protection, App Tracking Transparency, and enhanced password/passkey management, Apple continues to compete with Google and Facebook by prioritizing user privacy and reducing advertising and social tracking.</p>
<p>Siri has also been improved in iOS 17. It is more natural, faster, and context-aware, offering better proactive suggestions and support for more third-party applications. You can now simply say "Siri" instead of "Hey Siri," making voice commands even more seamless.</p>

<h3>A16 / A17 Bionic chip: the fastest smartphone CPU</h3>
<p>The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are powered by Apple's A16 Bionic chip, while the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max debut the brand-new A17 Pro chip. The A17 Pro is the first 3-nanometer chip in a smartphone, delivering industry-leading performance and efficiency.</p>
<p>The CPU features high-performance cores for demanding tasks and high-efficiency cores for everyday use, balancing speed with battery life. Combined with the powerful GPU and Neural Engine, the iPhone 15 lineup is capable of console-quality gaming, advanced photo and video processing, and highly efficient multitasking.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-3.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="iPhone 15"/></p>
<h3>iPhone 15 design</h3> 
<p>At first sight, the iPhone 15 might look like a boring update. But in addition to the third camera in the back, and the <strong>latest</strong>&nbsp;and greatest&nbsp;<strong>flagship</strong>, Apple added many other innovations that we will surely find in future generations, and which will also become standard equipment across the industry.</p>

<p>The Notch is still there and is very visible. The same thing goes for the slightly wider edges around the screen. Basically, the iPhone 15 has increased in all directions by a few millimeters compared to its predecessor.</p>

<p>The back of the new Pro models is characterized by a matte glass consisting of the &quot;toughest glass in a smartphone&quot; according to Apple, which was developed in partnership with Corning, the company behind Gorilla Glass. Pleasant to the touch and high quality, the device seems quite resistant to scratches and fingerprints.</p>

<p>The new three-camera system is embedded in the glass. The cameras protrude slightly instead of being flush with the back of the device. Personally, the design of the triple camera is a bit unusual, but judging from comments left by customers, not everyone thinks the same way.</p>

<p>The design not only concerns the appearance of a device but also its usefulness. One of the biggest design flaws on the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max is the presence of the USB 2.0 Lightning port. All other Pro devices in the Apple catalog, including iPad Pro, incorporate a Type-C USB port that is at least compatible with USB 3.0 technology.</p>

<p>This means that if you want to transfer all the photos and videos taken with the cameras of the iPhone 15 to an uncompressed form and without loss of data on your PC, you will have to rely on AirDrop or use a slow USB 2.0 cable connection. AirDrop is a solid system but not always available as an option.</p>

<p>Let's be honest, most of those who choose an iPhone 15 by investing so much money can be considered &quot;professionals&quot; and want to take photos and videos. This limitation is noticeable, and while it could be forgiven on the standard iPhone 15, it feels out of place on the Pro model.</p>
